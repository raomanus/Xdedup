The following project contains an implementation of a system call in the form of a loadable kernel module.
The system call deduplicates two files if they contain the same content and are owned by the same user. 
This is done via three flags that are passed as arguments to the system call.
A partial deduplication feature is also supported which allows the user to write out common bytes in the two files to a third output file.
